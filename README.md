## Getting Started with Blockly-SGLJS
Blockly-SGLJS is a Blockly-based program that executes JavaScript code. The program consists of two files: index.html and sgl.js. It can be used with a browser on your PC or installed on a server and accessed over the network. It does not save anything on the server side; programs must be loaded and saved on your PC. Additionally, it provides persistence of programs using the browser's local storage.

## Features
- Simplified JavaScript syntax
- update function executed 60 times per second
- Commands executed at startup
- Graphical commands targeting surfaces
- Special display variable for canvas
- Keyboard and mouse input handling
- Save and load programs
- Export programs as standalone HTML files
